🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository: 💻

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/AJ22122003/PRODIGY_ML_TASK4.git](https://github.com/AJ22122003/PRODIGY_ML_TASK4.git)
cd PRODIGY_ML_TASK4
Explore the Jupyter Notebook: 📒 Open the Task4_Ajinkya.K.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to understand the implementation details.

Bash

jupyter notebook Task4_Ajinkya.K.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab Task4_Ajinkya.K.ipynb
Follow the Notebook: The notebook contains the step-by-step process:

Dataset Description: Information about the dataset used for training (number of classes, total number of samples, and preprocessing steps). 📊
Model Architecture: Details about the CNN model architecture, including layers, activation functions, and any special considerations. 🧱
Training Process: Code for training the model on the prepared dataset. 🏋️
Evaluation: Evaluation of the trained model's performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, etc.). 📈
(Optional) Real-time Demo: Code for using the trained model with live video input from a webcam. 📹
🧠 Model Architecture

[Describe your model architecture here. Include details such as the number of layers, types of layers (Convolutional, MaxPooling, Dense, etc.), activation functions used, and any specific design choices you made.]

💾 Dataset

[Describe the dataset used for training. Include information about the number of classes (different hand gestures), the total number of samples, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data (e.g., resizing, normalization).]

📊 Results

[Include the performance metrics of your model here. Mention the accuracy achieved on the test set, as well as other relevant metrics like precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. If visualizations are available in the notebook, mention them.]

🤝 Contributions

[Optional: If you'd like to encourage contributions, add a section here explaining how others can contribute (e.g., improving the model, adding support for more gestures, enhancing the real-time demo).]
